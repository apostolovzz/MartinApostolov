        <h2>Check for issues with your Wi-Fi network<br>
        If iOS or iPadOS detects an issue with your Wi-Fi<br> connection, you might see <br> a Wi-Fi recommendation under the name of the <br> Wi-Fi network that you're connected to. For example, you might <br> see the alert "No Internet Connection." <br> To get more information, tap the Wi-Fi network.</h2><br><br><br>
        <h1>4</h1><br>
        <h2>Check your cables and connections
        If you <br> still can't connect to your network or get online,<br> make sure that your router is <br> connected to the modem and turned on.</h2><br><br><br>
        <h1>5</h1><br>
        <h2>Reset your network settings
          If you're using iOS or<br> iPadOS 15 or later, tap Settings<br> > General > Transfer or Reset [Device] ><br> Reset > Reset Network Settings.
          If you're using <br> iOS or iPadOS 14 or earlier, tap Settings > General<br> > Reset > Reset Network Settings.
          This also resets Wi-Fi<br>networks and passwords, cellular settings,<br> and VPN and APN settings that you've used before.</h2><br><br><br><br>
